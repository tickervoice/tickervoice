# Why I develop and use stock voice alert?

   * I have lots stock to monitor,but I do not have enough monitors, I need voice alert program to keep an eye on other cared tickers no matter price or key indicator signal
   * I am watching a focused stock, but I may miss some key signal if I did not pay attention at key signal moment
   * I feel tedious as current price action not exciting, I watch movies or news to have fun, meanwhile I have my alert system to notify me if anything comes up
   * I am not at my desk but I still need to know the price and key signals in case I can stop my handy work and do necessary trades ,current only support wifi area via android app or where ever if you can hear from your computer speaker.
      - typical case while I am in kitchen, toilet, in bed, or doing other housework
